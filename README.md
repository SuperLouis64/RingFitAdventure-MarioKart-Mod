# RingFitAdventure-MarioKart-Mod
Play Mairo Kart 8 using the Ring Fit Adventure Mod! Tired of losing to blue shells? Now you can actually be tired losing in Mario kart with this mod. The idea is pretty simple: Jog/Run IRL to drive in-game. As simple as it does sound, I haven't had a workout this hard and fun since the gym. Jogging on-and-off for an hour dodging items is a pretty good workout. If you end up using the mod for YouTube, Twitch, etc, all I ask is to be credited, don't be a jerk about it (seriously, don't make me put this stuff behind a different licences and patreon).

### Overall Design of the Mod
As mentioned earlier it's a very simple idea. Jogging presses the acceleration button so when you have to move IRL to go foward in-game. No other buttons are locked behind exercising like my other Ring Fit Mods. You also DO NOT NEED the ringcon, however it does make things easier:
- Jogging acclerates kart
- "Jumping" will give you a boost off ramps
- Leg-strap joycon is disabled 
- In-hand Joycon's face buttons and joystick are not affected by the mod

### Hardware Needed
This mod does require additional hardware to get running. I have a tutorial for how to set it up this mod on <https://www.controllerbend.com/mariokart-ring-fit.html>
- Titan Two Input Converter
- RingCon and Legstrap (not needed but helps)
- Titan Two Wireless Expansion Kit

### Software Needed
To interact with the Titan Two, you'll need to download Gtuner IV. "Gtuner IV is the main software for programming, updating and configuring the Titan Two device, featuring an complete IDE with integrated compiler for the GPC script language. Gtuner IV also provides user friendly interfaces for easy download, configure and use gamepacks or user made scripts. Based in a modern framework, Gtuner IV supports multi-platform, high resolution monitors and localization" - ConsoleTuner's site.

- Make sure to read over how the hardware/software works on the website. Message me if it still doesn't make sense but if I can figure it out you'll be fine!
